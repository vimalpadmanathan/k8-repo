- enables communication between various components within / outside of application
- each pod will have its own service. 

Traffic Routing:
1. NodePort
2. ClusterIP
3. Load Balancer
4. Ingress: 

ClusterIP (default) - Exposes the Service on an internal IP in the cluster. This type makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster.

NodePort - Exposes the Service on the same port of each selected Node in the cluster using NAT. Makes a Service accessible from outside the cluster using <NodeIP>:<NodePort>. Superset of ClusterIP.

LoadBalancer - Creates an external load balancer in the current cloud (if supported) and assigns a fixed, external IP to the Service. Superset of NodePort.


1. NodePort - 30,000 – 32,767 port # used

For NodePort - check nodeport.yaml
For ClusterIP - check cluster-ip.yaml

default is the namespace --- it is created when kubernetes is set up

kube-system    -- which required by k8 --- where no one should delete it.
 
kube-public ---- where users can access it / houses publicly accessible data, like the information needed to communicate with the Kubernetes API


where Dev and prod uses same EKS cluster, you can name DEV and Prod as Namespace.

you can assign quota to Namespace --- where it will not access more resources.

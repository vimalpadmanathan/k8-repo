- a zero-downtime deployment strategy that uses two identical production environments,
- "blue" and "green," to release new application versions safely

- Rollback (if needed): If a critical issue is detected after the switch,
- traffic can be immediately and instantly rerouted back to the "blue" environment, which is still running the old version.
